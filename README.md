# Spirograph Drawing Tool

This Python app utilizes the `turtle` module to create beautiful spirograph designs with customizable gap sizes and random colors. It demonstrates the use of randomization and basic graphics programming in Python.

# Features:

- **Spirograph Creation**:
  - Draws a circular pattern of overlapping circles with customizable gap sizes.
  - Uses the turtle graphics module for visualization.
- **Randomized Colors**:
  - Each circle is drawn with a randomly generated color.
- **Interactive and Visual**:
  - Displays the spirograph design in a graphical window.

# How to Use:

- Run the script using the command:

  ```bash
  python drawgraph.py
  ```

- The program will:

  - Open a graphical window.
  - Draw a spirograph pattern with a default gap size of 5 degrees.
  - Use random colors for each circle.

- Modify the `gap_size` parameter in the `draw_spirograph()` function to create different designs.

# Example Output:

- A circular, colorful spirograph pattern is displayed in a graphical window.
- Each circle in the pattern has a unique, randomly generated color.

# Prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The `turtle` module (pre-installed with Python).

# Customization:

- Change the gap size in the `draw_spirograph(gap_size)` function to adjust the design density.
- Modify the `set_color()` function to use specific color schemes instead of random colors.
